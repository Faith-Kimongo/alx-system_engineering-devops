# The Magic Behind the Scenes: What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com

Have you ever wondered what happens when you type a URL into your browser and press Enter? It's a seemingly simple action, but behind the scenes, a complex series of events unfolds to bring you the webpage you requested. In this post, we'll explore what happens when you type https://www.google.com into your browser and press Enter.

**Step 1: DNS Request**

When you type https://www.google.com into your browser, the first step is to resolve the domain name "google.com" into an IP address. This is done through a DNS (Domain Name System) request. Your browser sends a request to a DNS resolver, which is usually provided by your operating system or internet service provider. The DNS resolver then queries a DNS server to find the IP address associated with google.com. The DNS server responds with the IP address, which is typically in the format of 216.58.194.174.

**Step 2: TCP/IP**

Once the IP address is obtained, your browser establishes a connection to the server using the TCP/IP protocol. TCP/IP is a set of communication protocols that allow devices to communicate with each other over the internet. The TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) layer establishes a connection-oriented communication channel, ensuring that data is delivered in the correct order. The IP (Internet Protocol) layer routes the data packets between networks.

**Step 3: Firewall**

As the request reaches the Google network, it passes through a firewall. A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. The firewall checks the request to ensure it meets the security criteria, such as the type of traffic, source IP address, and destination port. If the request is legitimate, the firewall allows it to pass through.

**Step 4: HTTPS/SSL**

Since we typed "https" instead of "http", the request is encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security). HTTPS is an extension of HTTP that adds an extra layer of security by encrypting the data in transit. The browser and server negotiate an SSL/TLS handshake, which establishes a secure connection. This ensures that any data exchanged between the browser and server remains confidential and tamper-proof.

**Step 5: Load Balancer**

The request then reaches a load balancer, which is a device or software that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve responsiveness and availability. The load balancer directs the request to one of the many available web servers, ensuring that no single server is overwhelmed with requests.

**Step 6: Web Server**

The request finally reaches a web server, which is responsible for hosting and serving web pages. The web server receives the request, processes it, and retrieves the necessary resources, such as HTML, CSS, and images. In the case of Google, the web server is likely a customized server designed to handle high traffic volumes.

**Step 7: Application Server**

The web server may also interact with an application server, which is responsible for executing server-side logic, such as processing search queries or retrieving data from a database. The application server may perform additional processing, such as caching, authentication, or content generation.

**Step 8: Database**

In the case of Google, the application server may interact with a database to retrieve search results, user data, or other relevant information. The database is a repository of structured data that is optimized for fast retrieval and querying. The application server retrieves the necessary data from the database and passes it back to the web server.

**The Final Step: Page Rendering**

The web server assembles the retrieved resources and data into a complete HTML page, which is then sent back to your browser. Your browser renders the page, displaying the search results, ads, and other content that makes up the Google homepage.

In conclusion, typing https://www.google.com into your browser and pressing Enter triggers a complex series of events that involve DNS resolution, TCP/IP communication, firewall security, HTTPS encryption, load balancing, web server processing, application server logic, and database queries. The next time you perform a search, remember the intricate dance of technologies that work together to bring you the results you need.
